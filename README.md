# Human Myokine Signaling Study Overview
This repository provides all scripts a walk-through to repeat analyses shwon in Velez, Van et al. 2021

# Analyses are broken down into 3 sections:
  ## 1: Myokine differential expression by sex and muslce-specific enrichments
  ## 2: Cross-tissue signaling for myokines in the context of sex and hormones
  ## 3: Generation of pseudo-single-cell muscle maps and cross-tissue regressions

# Datasets (pre-processed) used in this study are available here:
